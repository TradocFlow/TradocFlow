# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating a functional markdown editor in TradocFlow Core. The current codebase has compilation issues that prevent the application from running. The goal is to fix these issues and create a working markdown editor with dual-mode editing (markdown source and WYSIWYG preview) and Word document import capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Compilation Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TradocFlow Core to compile successfully, so that I can run and test the markdown editor functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `cargo check` on tradocflow-core THEN the compilation SHALL complete without errors
2. WHEN I run `cargo build` on tradocflow-core THEN the build SHALL succeed and produce a working binary
3. IF there are missing dependencies THEN the system SHALL have all required dependencies properly configured
4. WHEN I run the main binary THEN the application SHALL start without crashing

### Requirement 2: Functional Markdown Editor

**User Story:** As a technical writer, I want a markdown editor with dual editing modes, so that I can write content in both raw markdown and WYSIWYG format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the application THEN I SHALL see a markdown editor interface
2. WHEN I click on "Markdown Mode" THEN I SHALL see raw markdown text with syntax highlighting
3. WHEN I click on "Preview Mode" THEN I SHALL see rendered HTML preview of the markdown
4. WHEN I edit text in markdown mode THEN the preview SHALL update in real-time
5. WHEN I edit text in preview mode (inline editing) THEN the markdown source SHALL update accordingly
6. WHEN I use keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+B, Ctrl+I, etc.) THEN the appropriate markdown formatting SHALL be applied
7. WHEN I use toolbar buttons THEN the corresponding markdown syntax SHALL be inserted or applied

### Requirement 3: Word Document Import

**User Story:** As a technical writer, I want to import Word documents and convert them to markdown, so that I can work with existing documentation in the markdown editor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Import Documents" THEN I SHALL see a file selection dialog
2. WHEN I select up to 5 Word documents (.docx, .doc) THEN the system SHALL accept them for import
3. WHEN I confirm the import THEN each document SHALL be converted to markdown format
4. WHEN the conversion is complete THEN I SHALL see the markdown content in the editor
5. WHEN importing multiple documents THEN they SHALL be treated as chapters of a single document
6. IF a document cannot be converted THEN I SHALL see a clear error message with the reason
7. WHEN the import is successful THEN I SHALL be able to edit the converted markdown content

### Requirement 4: Basic File Operations

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save and load markdown files, so that I can persist my work and continue editing later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Save" or press Ctrl+S THEN the current markdown content SHALL be saved to a file
2. WHEN I click "Open" or press Ctrl+O THEN I SHALL be able to select and load a markdown file
3. WHEN I create a new document THEN I SHALL start with a blank editor
4. WHEN I have unsaved changes and try to close THEN I SHALL be prompted to save my work
5. WHEN I save a file THEN the window title SHALL show the filename

### Requirement 5: Language Support

**User Story:** As a technical writer working with multilingual documentation, I want to specify the language of my content, so that the system can handle language-specific features appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the editor THEN I SHALL see a language selector in the toolbar
2. WHEN I select a language THEN the editor SHALL be configured for that language
3. WHEN I import documents THEN I SHALL be able to specify the source language
4. WHEN working with multiple languages THEN each language version SHALL be clearly identified
5. WHEN switching languages THEN the appropriate content SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when operations succeed or fail, so that I understand what's happening and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an operation is in progress THEN I SHALL see a progress indicator
2. WHEN an operation completes successfully THEN I SHALL see a success message
3. WHEN an operation fails THEN I SHALL see a clear error message explaining what went wrong
4. WHEN importing documents THEN I SHALL see progress for each document being processed
5. WHEN there are validation errors THEN I SHALL see specific details about what needs to be fixed

### Requirement 7: Basic Markdown Features

**User Story:** As a technical writer, I want support for common markdown elements, so that I can create rich formatted documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use heading syntax (# ## ###) THEN the preview SHALL show properly formatted headings
2. WHEN I use emphasis syntax (**bold**, *italic*) THEN the preview SHALL show formatted text
3. WHEN I create lists (- or 1.) THEN the preview SHALL show properly formatted lists
4. WHEN I insert links [text](url) THEN the preview SHALL show clickable links
5. WHEN I insert images ![alt](url) THEN the preview SHALL display the images
6. WHEN I use code blocks (```) THEN the preview SHALL show formatted code
7. WHEN I use tables THEN the preview SHALL show properly formatted tables

### Requirement 8: Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a user, I want the editor to be responsive and performant, so that I can work efficiently without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type in the editor THEN the response SHALL be immediate (< 50ms)
2. WHEN I switch between modes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth (< 200ms)
3. WHEN I import large documents THEN the UI SHALL remain responsive
4. WHEN rendering preview THEN the update SHALL complete within 500ms for typical documents
5. WHEN working with multiple documents THEN memory usage SHALL remain reasonable
