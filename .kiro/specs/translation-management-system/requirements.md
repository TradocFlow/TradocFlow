# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive translation management system for collaborative document translation workflows. The system enables users to create translation projects, import Word documents in multiple languages, manage translation memories using DuckDB and Parquet files, collaborate through role-based access control, and export finished translations to PDF. The system integrates a Slint-based markdown editor with side-by-side language views and a web-based Kanban board for project management.
