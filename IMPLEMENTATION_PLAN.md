    }
}
```

## Architecture Implementation Details

### Service Layer Architecture

```rust
// Core service trait
pub trait TranslationService: Send + Sync {
    type Error: std::error::Error + Send + Sync + 'static;
    
    async fn initialize(&self) -> Result<(), Self::Error>;
    async fn shutdown(&self) -> Result<(), Self::Error>;
}

// Service container for dependency injection
pub struct ServiceContainer {
    project_service: Arc<ProjectService>,
    translation_memory_service: Arc<TranslationMemoryService>,
    terminology_service: Arc<TerminologyService>,
    collaboration_service: Arc<CollaborationService>,
    backup_service: Arc<BackupService>,
}

impl ServiceContainer {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        // Initialize all services with proper dependency injection
    }
}
```

### Database Integration Strategy

```rust
// Database connection management
pub struct DatabaseManager {
    sqlite_pool: Arc<SqlitePool>,
    duckdb_connection: Arc<Mutex<DuckDBConnection>>,
}

impl DatabaseManager {
    pub async fn initialize_schemas(&self) -> Result<()> {
        self.run_migrations().await?;
        self.create_indexes().await?;
        self.optimize_performance().await?;
        Ok(())
    }
    
    pub async fn run_migrations(&self) -> Result<()> {
        // Run SQLite and DuckDB schema migrations
    }
}
```

### API Server Architecture

```rust
// REST API server setup
pub async fn create_api_server(services: Arc<ServiceContainer>) -> Result<Router> {
    let app = Router::new()
        .route("/api/projects", post(create_project))
        .route("/api/projects/:id", get(get_project))
        .route("/api/projects/:id/chapters", get(list_chapters))
        .route("/api/projects/:id/translation-memory/search", get(search_translations))
        .layer(Extension(services))
        .layer(CorsLayer::permissive());
    
    Ok(app)
}

// API handlers
async fn create_project(
    Extension(services): Extension<Arc<ServiceContainer>>,
    Json(request): Json<CreateProjectRequest>,
) -> Result<Json<Project>, ApiError> {
    let project = services.project_service.create_project(request).await?;
    Ok(Json(project))
}
```

## Quality Assurance Strategy

### Code Quality Standards
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% for core business logic
- **Documentation**: All public APIs must have rustdoc comments
- **Performance**: All database queries must complete within SLA limits
- **Security**: All user inputs must be validated and sanitized

### Testing Strategy
```rust
// Performance benchmarks
#[bench]
fn bench_translation_memory_search(b: &mut Bencher) {
    let service = setup_translation_memory_service();
    b.iter(|| {
        service.search_similar_translations("test text", language_pair)
    });
}

// Integration test structure
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_full_project_lifecycle() {
    let container = ServiceContainer::new();
    
    // Test project creation
    let project = container.project_service
        .create_project(create_test_project_request())
        .await
        .expect("Failed to create project");
    
    // Test document import
    let documents = container.document_import_service
        .import_multi_language_documents(test_documents(), language_mapping())
        .await
        .expect("Failed to import documents");
    
    // Test translation memory operations
    // Test export functionality
    // Test collaboration features
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **DuckDB Performance**: Implement query optimization and indexing strategies
2. **Memory Usage**: Add memory monitoring and cleanup mechanisms
3. **Concurrent Access**: Implement proper locking and transaction management
4. **Data Corruption**: Add data validation and integrity checks

### Implementation Risks
1. **Timeline Delays**: Prioritize core features over nice-to-have functionality
2. **Integration Issues**: Implement comprehensive integration testing
3. **Performance Degradation**: Continuous performance monitoring and optimization
4. **User Experience**: Regular usability testing and feedback collection

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Performance**: Translation memory queries <100ms (95th percentile)
- **Reliability**: >99.9% uptime for core functionality
- **Scalability**: Support projects with >100K translation units
- **Memory Efficiency**: <500MB memory usage for typical projects

### User Experience Metrics
- **Usability**: <5 clicks to complete common workflows
- **Responsiveness**: UI actions complete within 200ms
- **Reliability**: <1% error rate for user operations
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
```bash
# Setup development environment
git clone https://github.com/TradocFlow/TradocFlow.git
cd TradocFlow
cargo build --release
./target/release/tradocflow
```

### Production Deployment
- **Desktop Application**: Cross-platform binaries for Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Web Interface**: Static deployment with CDN for JavaScript assets
- **Database**: Local SQLite and DuckDB files with backup to cloud storage

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to completing the remaining 25% of TradocFlow functionality. The focus is on reliability, performance, and user experience while maintaining the high-quality architecture already established. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring stable progress toward a production-ready translation management system.

The key to success will be maintaining focus on core functionality while avoiding feature creep, implementing comprehensive testing throughout the development process, and continuously validating the solution against real-world translation workflows.
