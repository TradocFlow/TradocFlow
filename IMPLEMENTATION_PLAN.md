# Tradocflow Implementation Plan - Simplified

**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Timeline:** 12 weeks (6 phases × 2 weeks)  
**Focus:** Connect 80+ UI callbacks to existing backend services + advanced features

## Current State
- ✅ **Backend Complete**: Full API, services, database, models
- ✅ **UI Structure Complete**: Slint interface with all components  
- ❌ **Integration Missing**: UI callbacks show placeholder messages

## Core Implementation Pattern
```rust
// Pattern for all callback implementations
fn ui_callback(&self, param: Type) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let result = self.backend_service.method(param)?;
    self.app_state.update(result);
    self.ui_updater.refresh_ui();
    Ok(())
}
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Existing Backend Services (Already Available)
The codebase already contains these complete backend services:
- `GitManager` - Git operations and repository management
- `KanbanSync` - Kanban board integration with git
- `GitDiffTools` - Advanced diff and comparison tools
- `TranslationService` - Translation memory and validation
- `ReviewSystem` - Comment and approval workflows  
- `DocumentImportService` - File import/export capabilities
- `ProjectManager` - Project lifecycle management
- `I18n` - Internationalization and localization

### Critical Missing Phases
The original simplified plan omitted these essential phases:
- **Phase 3-4**: Git integration and advanced translation features (core differentiators)
- **Phase 5**: Professional productivity tools and workflow optimization
- **Phase 6**: Testing, deployment, and production readiness

### Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Start with Phase 1 document operations (Weeks 1-2)
2. **Foundation**: Complete Phase 2 translation workflows (Weeks 3-4)  
3. **Core Value**: Implement Phase 3 git integration (Weeks 5-6) - **CRITICAL**
4. **Professional**: Add Phase 4 advanced translation features (Weeks 7-8)
5. **Polish**: Complete Phase 5 productivity tools (Weeks 9-10)
6. **Release**: Finish Phase 6 testing and deployment (Weeks 11-12)

### Risk Mitigation
- Phases 1-2 are safe (existing backend services)
- Phases 3-4 leverage existing `git_integration/` modules 
- Phase 5-6 are polish/testing phases
- All backend services already implemented - UI integration only
