# Cursor Blinking and Focus Management Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive cursor blinking and focus management implementation for the TradocFlow markdown editor. The system ensures that only one editor pane shows a blinking cursor at a time across all layout modes (single, horizontal, vertical, and 2x2 grid).

## Core Components Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Text Editor (`enhanced_text_editor.slint`)

**Key Features:**
- **Cursor Blinking Animation**: Timer-based cursor blinking with 500ms intervals
- **Focus State Management**: Visual indicators for focused vs inactive editors
- **Touch Area Focus Handling**: Proper focus request and capture mechanics
- **Border and Shadow Effects**: Visual feedback showing which editor is active

**Cursor Blinking Logic:**
```slint
cursor-blink-timer := Timer {
    interval: root.blink-interval;
    running: root.has-editor-focus && root.enable-cursor-blink && root.selection.start == root.selection.end && !root.read-only;
    
    triggered => {
        root.cursor-blink-state = !root.cursor-blink-state;
    }
}
```

**Focus States:**
- **Focused State**: Blue border, enhanced drop shadow, visible cursor
- **Inactive State**: Gray border, minimal shadow, no cursor blinking

### 2. Focus Management Service (`focus_management_service.rs`)

**Core Responsibilities:**
- Track focus state across all editor instances
- Coordinate cursor blinking timing
- Handle focus switching between panes
- Manage keyboard navigation (Tab, Ctrl+Tab, Alt+1-4)

**Key Features:**
- **Single Active Editor**: Only one editor has focus at any time
- **Cursor Visibility Control**: Cursor only blinks in the active editor
- **Layout Awareness**: Adapts to single, horizontal, vertical, and grid layouts
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Full support for focus navigation

**Editor State Management:**
```rust
pub struct EditorFocusState {
    pub editor_id: String,
    pub pane_id: String,
    pub language: String,
    pub has_focus: bool,
    pub cursor_position: usize,
    pub selection_start: usize,
    pub selection_end: usize,
    pub cursor_visible: bool,
    pub is_blinking: bool,
    pub last_activity: Instant,
}
```

### 3. Focus Management Component (`focus_management.slint`)

**Purpose**: Reusable focus-aware editor component with built-in cursor management

**Features:**
- **Global Focus Coordination**: Manages focus across multiple editor instances
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab navigation between editors
- **Cursor Blink Synchronization**: Synchronized blinking across all editors

### 4. Main Window Integration (`main.slint`)

**Layout Support:**
- **Single Layout**: One editor with full focus management
- **Horizontal Layout**: Two editors (left/right) with Tab navigation
- **Vertical Layout**: Two editors (top/bottom) with Tab navigation  
- **Grid 2x2 Layout**: Four editors with Alt+1-4 shortcuts

**Focus Management Integration:**
Each editor pane includes:
```slint
editor-id: "pane-1-editor";
pane-id: "pane-1";
has-focus: root.pane-1-focused;

focus-requested => {
    root.editor-focus-requested("pane-1-editor", "pane-1");
}

focus-granted => {
    // Clear focus from other panes
    root.pane-1-focused = true;
    root.pane-2-focused = false;
    root.pane-3-focused = false;
    root.pane-4-focused = false;
    root.active-editor-id = "pane-1-editor";
    root.active-pane-id = "pane-1";
    root.editor-focus-granted("pane-1-editor");
}

focus-lost => {
    root.pane-1-focused = false;
    root.editor-focus-lost("pane-1-editor");
}
```

## Keyboard Navigation

### Focus Switching
- **Tab**: Focus next editor in sequence
- **Shift+Tab**: Focus previous editor in sequence
- **Ctrl+Tab**: Navigate between editors (enhanced mode)
- **Ctrl+Shift+Tab**: Reverse navigate between editors

### Direct Editor Access
- **Alt+1**: Focus first editor/pane
- **Alt+2**: Focus second editor/pane  
- **Alt+3**: Focus third editor/pane (grid layout)
- **Alt+4**: Focus fourth editor/pane (grid layout)

## Cursor Blinking Behavior

### Active Editor
- **Visible Cursor**: Always visible when editor has focus
- **Blinking Animation**: 500ms on/off cycle when no text is selected
- **Selection Override**: Cursor remains visible when text is selected
- **Read-Only Mode**: No cursor blinking in read-only editors

### Inactive Editors
- **No Cursor**: Cursor is completely hidden
- **No Blinking**: No animation or visual cursor indication
- **Clear Indication**: Visual styling shows inactive state

## Layout-Specific Behavior

### Single Layout
- **One Active Editor**: "single-editor" with full focus
- **No Navigation**: Tab navigation not applicable
- **Full Focus**: All keyboard input directed to single editor

### Horizontal/Vertical Layout  
- **Two Editors**: "left-editor" and "right-editor"
- **Tab Navigation**: Switch between left and right editors
- **Content Sync**: Optional content synchronization between panes

### Grid 2x2 Layout
- **Four Editors**: "pane-1-editor" through "pane-4-editor"
- **Alt+Number**: Direct access to specific panes
- **Sequential Navigation**: Tab cycles through all four panes
- **Independent Content**: Each pane maintains separate content

## Visual Feedback

### Focused Editor
- **Primary Border**: Blue (#007ACC) border with 2px width
- **Enhanced Shadow**: 6px blur with primary color shadow
- **Blinking Cursor**: Visible cursor with 500ms blink cycle

### Inactive Editor
- **Neutral Border**: Gray (#E0E0E0) border with 1px width  
- **Subtle Shadow**: 2px blur with minimal shadow
- **No Cursor**: Completely hidden cursor

## Integration Points

### Backend Integration
The Rust backend needs to:
1. Initialize `FocusManagementService` for the current layout
2. Register all editor instances with unique IDs
3. Handle focus request/grant/loss events from UI
4. Process keyboard shortcuts for navigation
5. Update cursor position and selection state
6. Tick cursor blinking timer every 500ms

### UI Integration  
The Slint UI needs to:
1. Include focus management callbacks in all EditorPane components
2. Bind focus state properties to visual styling
3. Forward keyboard events to focus management system
4. Update active editor indicators in real-time
5. Handle layout changes by re-registering editors

## Performance Considerations

### Cursor Blinking Timer
- **Single Global Timer**: One timer coordinates all cursor blinking
- **Efficient Updates**: Only update cursor state for active editor
- **Background Processing**: Cursor blinking runs in background thread

### Focus State Updates
- **Minimal UI Updates**: Only update changed focus states
- **Batch Updates**: Group multiple state changes into single update
- **Event Throttling**: Prevent excessive focus change events

## Accessibility Features

### Keyboard Navigation
- **Standard Navigation**: Full keyboard navigation support
- **Screen Reader**: Proper focus announcements
- **High Contrast**: Clear visual focus indicators

### Visual Indicators
- **Color Blind Safe**: Focus indicators don't rely only on color
- **High Contrast**: Sufficient contrast ratios for all indicators
- **Motion Sensitivity**: Cursor blinking can be disabled

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Tests
- **Focus State Management**: Unit tests for focus service
- **Layout Switching**: Test focus behavior across layouts
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Automated keyboard event testing
- **Cursor Blinking**: Timer and state update testing

### Manual Testing
- **Multi-Layout**: Test focus switching in all layouts
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Verify all keyboard shortcuts work
- **Visual Feedback**: Confirm proper visual indicators
- **Edge Cases**: Test rapid focus switching, layout changes

## Known Limitations

### Slint Specific
- **TextEdit Limitations**: Some cursor control features limited by Slint
- **Focus Chain**: Complex focus chains may need custom handling
- **Animation Constraints**: Limited animation options for focus transitions

### Performance
- **Timer Frequency**: 500ms blink rate may not be suitable for all users
- **Layout Switching**: Brief focus loss during layout transitions
- **Memory Usage**: Focus state tracking adds minimal memory overhead

## Future Enhancements

### User Customization
- **Blink Rate**: Allow users to customize cursor blink timing
- **Focus Colors**: Customizable focus indicator colors
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Configurable navigation shortcuts

### Advanced Features
- **Focus History**: Remember last focused editor per layout
- **Split Pane Sync**: Advanced content synchronization options
- **Focus Policies**: Different focus behaviors for different contexts

## Conclusion

The cursor blinking and focus management implementation provides a comprehensive solution for multi-pane text editing with clear visual feedback and intuitive navigation. The system is designed to be performant, accessible, and maintainable while providing a professional user experience across all supported layouts.

The implementation follows modern UI/UX patterns and provides the foundation for future enhancements to the TradocFlow markdown editor system.
